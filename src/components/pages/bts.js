        <h2>Sky Train Station</h2>
        <p>
          The sky train is one of the most widely used public transportation systems in Bangkok. In 2019, while I was studying abroad and feeling homesick, I decided to design this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the third design I ever completed in my entire life. Looking back now, the design feels simple, and I didnâ€™t use any advanced techniques. However, it still stands as one of my proudest achievements in my journey, marking an important milestone on my road map.
